
The full-text corpus data is available in three different formats.
When you purchase the data, you purchase the rights to all three formats,
and you can download whichever ones you want.

Samples: The sample data that is linked to below is taken completely at
random from each of the corpora (usually about 1/100th the total number of texts).
No attempt has been made to "clean up" this sample data in any way.
If you're happy with the sample data that you download,
 you should be equally as happy with the complete set of data.
Note that the size shown in the first column is the total amount of words that you can download, after purchasing the data. The size in the other three columns is for the samples. Note also that the shared files below (sources and lexicon) are just for the sample texts.
